Enough crude oil is being produced to meet global demand, but the ability of the Gulf Coast's many refineries to turn the oil into gasoline has been devastated, as has the ability to transport the gasoline that does become available. Those supply bottlenecks are chiefly responsible for this past week's higher prices at the pump.     President Bush's immediate response is to lend oil from the government's Strategic Petroleum Reserve to refineries and to streamline the refining process by temporarily relaxing environmental standards -- sound stopgap measures to help ensure a steady supply of gasoline. The International Energy Agency, whose members are 26 rich nations, has also made a big contribution, pledging on Friday to supply world markets with an additional 60 million barrels of oil and gasoline over the next 30 days, half of which would come from the United States' emergency stockpiles.

Since the 18th century, when French colonial administrators required land claimants to establish ownership by building levees along bayous, streams and rivers, people have been trying to dominate the region's landscape and the forces of its nature.     As long as people could control floods, they could do business. But, as people learned too late, the landscape of South Louisiana depends on floods: it is made of loose Mississippi River silt, and the ground subsides as this silt consolidates. Only regular floods of muddy water can replenish the sediment and keep the landscape above water. But flood control projects channel the river's nourishing sediment to the end of the birdfoot delta and out into the deep water of the Gulf of Mexico.

OK,Copyright (c) 2022 The New York Times Company. All Rights Reserved.," Prices for Energy Futures Soar In the Wake of Hurricane Katrina  As the extent of the damage on offshore facilities in the Gulf of Mexico slowly became apparent a day after Hurricane Katrina's passage, oil prices soared above $70 a barrel and gasoline futures jumped by 20 percent on concerns it would take months to restore production. On the New York Mercantile Exchange, crude oil futures closed at $69.81 a barrel, after touching a high of $70.85 earlier in the day. [Page C1.]    Economists warned that Katrina was likely to leave a deeper mark on the national economy than previous hurricanes because of its profound disruption to the Gulf of Mexico's complex energy supply network. [C1.]    Stocks skidded in the aftermath of the hurricane, which pounded hotels and casinos, constricted oil refinery capacity and left insurers to cover losses estimated at up to $25 billion. The Dow closed down 50.23 points, at 10,412.82. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index fell 3.87 points, to 1,208.41, and the Nasdaq composite index fell 7.89 points, to 2,129.76. [C9.]    The airline industry felt the delayed brunt of Hurricane Katrina, with some airports running low on jet fuel and carriers canceling hundreds more flights. Meanwhile, Wall Street feared the financial problems of the sickest airlines could grow worse. [C4.]     With offices and presses flooded, New Orleans media outlets mostly abandoned newsprint and television broadcasts and set up shop on the Web. [A10.]    U.S. Wins Round in Canadian Lumber Dispute  The United States won a potentially major victory when the World Trade Organization ruled that the imposition of duties on Canadian softwood lumber did not violate international law. The decision, which may yet be appealed, broadly contradicts the conclusions of a special Nafta panel that instructed Washington to refund $5 billion in tariffs. ''My message is very simple,'' Canada's trade minister, Jim Peterson, above, told reporters. ''We want the U.S. to live up to and respect the Nafta.'' [C6.]    After a Shake-Up, Signs of Accord at Citigroup  It has been a long, hot summer at Citigroup, filled with recriminating headlines and power-struggle intrigue, as the chief executive, Charles O. Prince, moved to cement his authority. But if Mr. Prince now has his team in place, as some Citigroup executives say they believe, that might alleviate at least some investor concerns. [C1.]    Money Seized in Arizona May Come From Hedge Fund  Authorities in Arizona have seized $101 million in a bank account that they say could be funds from Bayou, a hedge fund based in Connecticut.

The Tanai tribe accorded him the traditional greeting. General Tanai is just one of dozens of former Communists to make a political return, representing one of the most contentious issues of the campaign.  A3    Iran Rejects Europe's Demand  Iran rejected a call by Europe to halt its nuclear program in two weeks or face possible Security Council penalties, and said it would not give in to what it called bullying.  A3    Egypt to Ignore Poll Monitors  The counry's electoral commission said that it would not abide by a court ruling authorizing non-government organizations to monitor the coming election for president, a decision that effectively placed the commission above the law and called into question the integrity of the vote scheduled to take place on Wednesday.  A4    Egyptian investigators say they have concluded that three recent attacks in the Sinai Peninsula were linked. The assaults included the bombings at Taba in October and Sharm el Sheik in July and a smaller attack in August on peacekeepers in the Sinai.   A4    Schröder Debates Candidate  Germany's conservative leader, Angela Merkel, accused Chancellor Gerhard Schröder of saddling the country with record high unemployment and a faltering economy, as the two met in a televised debate two weeks before an election that most polls predict will make Mrs. Merkel the first female chancellor in German history.  A6    Fox Counters U.S. Criticism  President Vicente Fox responded to criticism from American authorities about a recent surge in violence and illegal immigration along the border, saying that the United States shares responsibility for the problems and should work harder with Mexico to fix them.  A6    Palestine Official Pleads Guilty  A prominent member of the Palestinian Parliament, Husam Khader, pleaded guilty in an Israeli military court to charges of assisting an armed Palestinian faction that has carried out many attacks against Israel, the military said.  A6    Hussein Trial to Start Oct. 19  The trial of Saddam Hussein will begin in six weeks, the Iraqi government said, when he and seven aides face a special tribunal on charges of massacring almost 150 residents from the town of Dujail, the scene of a failed assassination attempt against Mr. Hussein 23 years ago.  A6    Putin Shuffles Navy Command  President Vladimir V. Putin shuffled the Russian Navy's high command, a move expected after the latest submarine accident in August in which seven sailors aboard a mini-submarine were saved with the help of other countries.  A6    NATIONAL  A7-19    New Orleans SearchersAttention to the Dead  Troops patrolled the streets, rescuers hunted for stragglers and New Orleans looked like a wrecked ghost town as the evacuation of the city neared completion and officials turned to the task of collecting bodies in a ghastly landscape awash in possibly thousands of corpses.   A1    As the Bush administration tried to show a more forceful effort to help the victims of Hurricane Katrina, government officials escalated their criticism and sniping over who was to blame for the problems with the initial response.    A1    Strained by an influx of refugees , Texas struggled to house about a quarter-million victims of Hurricane Katrina in shelters and hotel rooms and began organizing an emergency airlift to divert thousands more to other states.    A13    The devastation wrought by Hurricane Katrina became a rallying cry for African-American religious and political leaders in Houston, President Bush's former hometown, with pleas for charity mixed with a seething anger at the response to the crisis.   A10    Perhaps not since Richard M. Nixon faced Vietnam-era tumult abroad and at home has an American president had to meet quite the combination of foreign war, domestic tribulations and political division that President Bush now confronts, from the Persian Gulf to the Gulf Coast to Capitol Hill.    A1    New Orleans police officers shot and killed four people and wounded two others who had fired at officers escorting a convoy of contractors across a bridge, the authorities said.   A13    Rehnquist Death Stirs Battle  The death of Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist opened a second front in the ideological battle over the Supreme Court, with President Bush saying he would act quickly to replace him. A senior Republican aide said the schedule for the Roberts confirmation hearings, which had been set to begin Tuesday, was expected to be revised.    A1    Advocacy groups on the left and the right scrambled to adjust to what had suddenly become a far more complicated struggle over judicial nominations with the death of Chief Justice Rehnquist.    A19    William H. Rehnquist, who died at the age of 80, almost a year after learning he had thyroid cancer, helped lead a conservative revolution on the Supreme Court during 19 years as chief justice of the United States.   A17    Supreme Court justices say they were as surprised as the rest of the country to learn that the chief justice had died.  A19    Labor Leaders See Opportunity  As they have on past Labor Days, the nation's union leaders are vowing to reverse labor's decline, but that goal is made more difficult this year by the schism in the A.F.L.-C.I.O.    A7    NEW YORK/REGION  B1-5    Candidates CriticizeResponse to Hurricane  Outrage over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina has worked its way into New York City's mayoral campaign, with the leading Democratic candidates using the crisis as a vehicle for broader assertions that Republicans have neglected the poor. While the candidates were careful not to attack Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg's response to the crisis, all four directed sharp rebukes at the Bush administration.    B1    New Strategy in Yonkers  Mayor Philip A. Amicone of Yonkers has recently held several town hall-style forums, urging residents to voice their opinions and ask questions of city officials. The meetings might be rather unremarkable in other places, but in a city where a history of nepotism fuels a sense of frustration and cynicism, the openness is a major shift in strategy and is giving some residents a reason for cautious optimism.   B1    SPORTSMONDAY  D1-9    Elder Sister Wins Sibling Match  The atmosphere in the all-Williams tennis match bore scant resemblance to the floodlit, electrically charged ambiance in their United States Open night finals past.

The special, with Diddy, left, as host, brought in an audience of 8.01 million, a big drop from last year's 10.32 million. The 2002 event, at which Eminem and his ""Without Me"" video were the big winners, stands as the award show's most-watched broadcast, with 11.95 million viewers. Despite this year's drop, Sunday's show was No. 1 on cable for the week in all adult demographics. On the network side, CBS won its 13th week in a row in total viewers and tied with Fox among 18- to 49-year-olds. Tuesday's Nielsen's estimates indicated a continuation of CBS's streak. Its lineup of an ""NCIS"" rerun (9.55 million), ""Big Brother"" (8.49 million) and ""Rock Star: INXS"" (6.72 million) didn't win every hour, but the combination easily beat all network competition among total viewers and the 18-to-49 demographic.

The meeting came barely a week before the leaders of India and Pakistan are to meet during the United Nations General Assembly session in New York.  A3    A Strike at Iraq Election Effort  The American military recently moved into a small town 10 miles south of Falluja, one of the most violent locales in Iraq, to secure it for the coming elections, and the insurgents took all of a day to respond. They fired a rocket that missed the Americans and landed on a nearby playground, killing a 12-year-old boy and wounding eight other children.  A7    In an unusual public rebuke, President Jalal Talabani angrily criticized other Arab states, saying they had insulted Iraq by not sending diplomats to Baghdad and had not sent condolence letters about the stampede last week in which almost 1,000 Shiite pilgrims were killed.  A7    13 Suspected Taliban Are Killed  Afghan and American forces mounted an operation into a remote mountainous district of southern Afghanistan in pursuit of a group of insurgents and killed 13 suspected Taliban and detained over 40 people, Afghan and American officials said.

A4    Chirac Recovers in Hospital  President Jacques Chirac is in the hospital recovering from what doctors describe as a minor condition affecting his sight, but the French are already writing his political epitaph. Though he has two years left in his term and has left open the possibility that he might run again, the media, political opponents and even his most loyal allies are acting as if he is already gone.

A12    Chernobyl Progress Report  Nearly 20 years after the huge accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant in Ukraine, a new scientific report has found that its aftereffects on health and the environment have not proved as dire as scientists had predicted. The report was prepared by a panel of more than 100 experts convened by United Nations agencies.  A10    NATIONAL  A16-25    Bush Returns to South Amid Criticism  As criticism raged over the federal government's response to Hurricane Katrina, President Bush returned to the Gulf Coast, and Army engineers resealed two levees that had been breached by the storm and cautiously began pumping water out of New Orleans.  A1    At a tan-colored warehouse next to the modest city hall in St. Gabriel, La., refrigerated trucks began bringing what are expected to be thousands of bodies to the temporary mortuary set up to process the victims of Hurricane Katrina.  A1    The Bush administration has been stung by criticism of its handling of the hurricane by anguished Louisiana officials and by nervous Republicans from across the country, but it has one stalwart defender right in the eye of the growing political storm, Gov. Haley Barbour of Mississippi.  A25    As President Bush and White House officials fanned out across the Gulf Coast in the White House's campaign to deal with criticism that it had failed in managing the storm's aftermath, there was one unexpected face in their crowd: former president Bill Clinton.  A25    Congressional leaders raced to spell out competing plans to help storm victims, offering proposals for emergency health care, housing and economic support, among other measures. Both parties also announced plans to begin hearings into the government's disaster response and into rising oil and gas prices.  A20    Bush's Choice for Chief Justice  President Bush said that he would nominate Judge John G. Roberts Jr., who had been his choice to fill the Supreme Court seat being vacated by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, to succeed William H. Rehnquist as chief justice of the United States.  A1    Georgia Voting Law Contested  Opponents of a new Georgia law requiring voters to show photo identification at the polls are planning a federal court lawsuit challenging the measure, which they fear will lower voter turnout. The bill eliminates the use of formerly accepted forms of voter identification, like Social Security cards, birth certificates or utility bills.  A17    Folic Acid and Birth Defects  A government decision to add folic acid to enriched grain products has reduced the occurrence of two devastating birth defects, but more needs to be done, according to recently published reports.

An estimated 6,000 children in this country have the specific condition for which the F.D.A. approved the drug, although some doctors expect it to be more broadly prescribed to children with less severe growth abnormalities.

All Rights Reserved.," INTERNATIONAL  A3-9    Shiites Threaten to BypassSunnis In New Constitution  A parliamentary session to present the Iraqi constitution was cancelled and President Bush personally called one of the country's most powerful Shiite leaders in an effort to broker a last-minute deal. The president intervened when some senior Shiite leaders said they had decided to bypass their Sunni counterparts and send the document directly to the Iraqi voters for their approval.  A1    The Shiite cleric Moktada al-Sadr called on his followers to end clashes with rival Shiite groups after a night of deadly street battles, and appealed for calm at a time of national political tension. In a separate development, the Iraqi police discovered 36 decomposing corpses in Kut province, southeast of Baghdad, an official at the Interior Ministry said.  A9    As Iraq's political leaders met this week in the fortified Green Zone to try to resolve the remaining disputes over the draft constitution, ordinary Iraqis were of various minds about what it all meant.  A9    A Year After Siege, Few Answers  Nearly a year after terrorists from a Chechen separatist group took over a school in Beslan, Russia, beginning a siege that ended in the deaths of 331 people, there is scarcely more clarity about what happened than there was immediately after the event. Most citizens of Beslan direct their rage at the Chechen terrorists but also, increasingly, at the Russian government.  A1    Abbas Chastises Israel  The Palestinian leader, Mahmoud Abbas, accused Israel of undermining peace efforts with an undercover military raid in the West Bank city of Tulkarm in which five Palestinians were killed. Israel said all five were ''armed wanted terrorists,'' including an Islamic Jihad leader who had orchestrated two suicide bombings, but Palestinians said three of the dead were unarmed teenagers.  A3    Mubarak Campaigns in Egypt  The re-election campaign of President Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, has touched off a debate about whether the country's first multicandidate presidential campaign is an honest first step toward a freer and more open political life in Egypt, or merely a facade intended to help preserve the power of the old guard.  A3    Kennedy Mulled Nuclear Option  In May 1963, President John F. Kennedy and his aides discussed the feasibility of using nuclear weapons in the event that China attacked India for a second time, according to newly declassified audio recordings that were released by the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston.  A8    Deadly Paris Fire  A fire swept through a dilapidated apartment building in southern Paris, killing at least 17 African immigrants and injuring 22, fire officials said. The dead included at least four children.  A4    NATIONAL  A10-16    Hurricane Katrina BringsHeavy Rain to Florida  Hurricane Katrina pushed ashore north of Miami, laden with heavy rain but not packing much of a wallop. Sustained winds of 80 miles per hour with gusts up to 92 m.p.h. bent palm trees and rattled windows, but there were no reports of heavy damage.

All Rights Reserved.," INTERNATIONAL   A3-10    Iraqi Leaders Present Disputed Constitution  Iraqi leaders presented a disputed constitution to Parliament, overriding the objections of Sunni negotiators and setting the stage for a protracted period of political conflict. President Bush praised the constitution as a milestone in Iraqi history, congratulating Iraqi leaders for ''completing the next step in their transition from dictatorship to democracy.''   A1    A soundman working for Reuters Television was shot dead in Baghdad, and a cameraman with him was wounded. An Iraqi police report said the two had been shot by American forces.   A8    A top Army contracting official who criticized a large, noncompetitive contract with the Halliburton Company for work in Iraq was demoted for what the Army called poor job performance. The official, Bunnatine H. Greenhouse, has worked in military procurement for 20 years.

A1    As ripples of vapor-filled turbulence began to organize into a storm over the steamy waters of the southeastern Bahamas, Tropical Depression 12 was born, giving few hints that it was an embryonic monster that would grow into Hurricane Katrina.   A13    For one of the few times since legal gambling arrived in Mississippi, the casinos that helped revive the Gulf Coast economy went dark, shutting down along with scores of other businesses.   A13    Energy companies rushed to shut down oil rigs and refineries and evacuate employees in the Gulf of Mexico, shrinking oil output in the area at a time when markets are already on edge over surging energy prices.   A12    Roberts's Grammar Precision  An obsession with rhetorical precision is a central John Roberts trait, according to friends and former colleagues of the man nominated by President Bush to become a Supreme Court justice. A cheerfully ruthless copy editor over the years, Judge Roberts has demanded verbal rigor from his colleagues and subordinates, refusing to tolerate the slightest grammatical slip -- and boasting an exceptional vocabulary and command of literature himself.

A8    NATIONAL  A9-16    New Orleans Levees Fail, Leaving City Uninhabitable  A day after New Orleans thought it had narrowly escaped the worst of Hurricane Katrina, water broke through two levees and all but submerged the city, causing incalculable destruction and rendering it uninhabitable for weeks to come.  A1    Word that the devastated New Orleans area would not be habitable at least until next week reverberated through the hotels and motels scattered along highways in every direction, as hundreds of thousands of evacuees who had packed limited provisions grappled with the new reality of long-term evacuation.  A1    Until engineers can repair breaks in the huge levees that separate New Orleans from Lake Pontchartrain, the city will essentially be an arm of the Gulf of Mexico, subject to the ebb and flow of the tides.

All Rights Reserved.,"HURRICANE RIPPLES With Hurricane Katrina pounding the New Orleans area yesterday, shutting airports from the western Florida Panhandle to Baton Rouge and creating mounting delays at Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International, a central connecting point for the South, here are some ways to plan ahead if you're traveling this week. A new Web service, www.flightstats.com, calculates status and delays for every domestic flight. (Click the link ''Sample Aps'' and then ''Airport Status.) ''You just drill in and see how your flight may be affected,'' said Meara McLaughlin, the head of business development and marketing for Flightstats. All major airline Web sites have a tool, usually called a flight tracker, that gives the real-time status of any flight, including anticipated delays. And the Federal Aviation Administration maintains a map showing real-time airport operating status at its Web site, www.faa.gov, under the Airport Status link. Individual airlines are also posting information about changing itineraries and canceling tickets on their own Web sites.    AMERICANS ABROAD -- Americans made a record 27.4 million trips overseas in 2004, an increase of almost 12 percent over 2003, according to the United States Department of Commerce. Kennedy International Airport in New York was the most popular departure point, with 4.7 million outbound international passengers.    FREE-STAY DAY -- Don't ignore those people handing out luggage tags today in business districts in New York, Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas and Los Angeles. As big hotel chains battle to promote their various guest-loyalty programs, hundreds of representatives of InterContinental Hotels will be distributing numerically coded luggage tags, and one in six of them will have a prize of $250 toward a stay at any hotel that accepts American Express cards. In all, there will be 1,000 winners. There are more than 3,500 InterContinental Hotels Group hotels with 535,000 rooms in 100 countries. But the promotion, on behalf of Intecontinental's Priority Club Rewards loyalty program, allows winners to use the awards even at rival hotels. The idea, InterContinental said, is to illustrate that its own loyalty program makes getting free stays easier than other programs. Winners can redeem hotel-stay vouchers at www.priorityclub.com/freestay.    PREMIUM LOUNGING -- Airlines with the top-rated premier services keep raising standards with their airport lounges. The latest example is Virgin Atlantic, which has opened Phase 1 of its new Upper Class Lounge at Heathrow Airport in London. It's next to the original Upper Class Lounge and has a spa pool, steam room and sauna, as well as dining and lounge areas. The original clubhouse is under renovation as Phase 2, with an opening planned for December, when Virgin's Heathrow Upper Class Lounge will have doubled in size, to 8,000 square feet.

Western Art in Iran       The Tehran Museum of Contemporary Art has put on display an exhibition that art experts call the most important collection of modern Western art outside Europe and the United States, Reuters reported. Spanning the 1870's to the 1980's, the exhibition, titled ''Modern Art Movement,'' includes works by Picasso, Monet, Andy Warhol and Jackson Pollock (whose ''Mural on Indian Red Ground'' is above). ''It's a sensational show for all of us,'' said Alireza Samiazar, the museum's director, ''and considering the political situation, it could be quite a controversial show as well.'' The museum's collection of Western art was largely amassed in the 1970's by Farah Pahlavi, widow of the Shah of Iran.

The only others to have scored the two top singles at once are OutKast, in 2004; Nelly, in 2002; the Bee Gees, in 1978; and the Beatles, in 1964.

He joined The New York Times in March of 1993 and worked with several advertising teams, influencing and, in many cases, dramatically changing the way that work and processes were done. For example, he was instrumental in the development of a new technology platform and program for our advertising agencies. Mitch was proud of his Advertising Leadership Award, which was a very well deserved honor and recognition of his many valuable contributions. Playwright, actor, music lover, technology guru, political activist, loyal friend, family man, father and grandfather. Mitch has passed all too soon, but still serves as a wonderful example to us all, to pursue and enjoy all that life has to offer. Perhaps the greatest lesson of all that Mitch taught us was to follow your heart, as he did throughout his life. Everyone who knew him came to realize quickly, how important family and friends were to him. Not only did he raise two extraordinary daughters on his own, he lived true to his promise, always to be close to those he loved.

All Rights Reserved.," In Storm's Wake, Turmoil in Energy Market Spurs Release of Strategic Petroleum Stocks  The nation's largest energy center was still reeling four days after Hurricane Katrina slammed into the Gulf of Mexico, crippling gasoline supplies in some pockets of the country. In the face of the turmoil, the government stepped up its release of strategic oil stocks to refiners. [Page C1.]    All across the country dealers posted eye-popping gasoline prices yesterday, reflecting panic in both dealers and consumers not seen since the days immediately after the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. [C1.]    Soaring gasoline prices and fears over gasoline supplies are causing Labor Day weekend travelers to calculate how much the trip will cost by car, whether it is cheaper to fly and how easy it will be to fill up.

[C1.]    Novartis Offers Chiron a Buyout Deal  The Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis said it had offered to pay $4.5 billion to take over Chiron, a troubled American biotechnology company. Novartis already owns 42 percent of Chiron, the world's second-largest producer of flu vaccines. In 2004, British regulators forced the closing of Chiron's factory in Liverpool because of quality problems, which led to a flu vaccine shortfall in the United States last year. [C3.]    German Executive Takes On a Rebuilding Job  In May, three years after being forced out of the media giant Bertelsmann, Thomas Middelhoff took on one of the most grueling corporate salvage jobs in Germany, at the troubled department store and mail-order chain KarstadtQuelle.

[C1.]    Chicago Case Said to Link Stun Gun to Heart Disturbance  A shock from a Taser stun gun caused a teenager in Chicago to go into ventricular fibrillation, a usually fatal heart disturbance, according to a letter published in The New England Journal of Medicine. In the Chicago case, the teenager received immediate medical attention and survived. [C3.]    Intel Gives Its Answer to Antitrust Lawsuit  In a sharp rebuttal to an antitrust lawsuit, Intel denied any wrongdoing and characterized Advanced Micro Devices, its rival and accuser, as a victim of its own mistakes. [C2.]    U.S. Imposes Quotas on Some More Chinese Textiles  The United States imposed quotas on imports of bras and certain expensive fabrics from China after American and Chinese trade negotiators failed to reach a deal in a brief meeting in Beijing. [C6.]    Tournament Tie-Ins Become a Whole New Game  The blue-chip sponsors of this year's United States Open tennis tournament, which include American Express, Canon and I.B.M., are more open than ever to trying nontraditional methods to reach consumers. Among the new tactics are special Web sites; podcasts of results and commentary; and elaborate promotional events built around the tennis stars Maria Sharapova and Andy Roddick, above. Stuart Elliott: Advertising. [C5.]    Hitachi to Introduce One-Inch Hard Drive  In the race to make ever-smaller disk drives for hand-held consumer appliances, Hitachi Ltd. is to announce that it has matched Seagate Technologies with what it says is the smallest drive on the market, a one-inch-diameter hard drive that holds eight gigabytes of data. [C2.]    Japanese Retailer Offers to Buy Remainder of 7-Eleven  Japan's largest retailer, Seven & I Holdings, said it was offering $1 billion to buy the 27 percent of 7-Eleven that it does not already own. [C6.]    G.M. Reports a Sharp Drop in August Sales  The brief sales honeymoon for the domestic automakers appears to be over. General Motors reported that sales dropped sharply in August, and the industry reported a weakness across the board in sales of the large sport utility vehicles that the domestic automakers, in particular, have depended on. [C3.]    Stocks Close Mixed After an Uneven Trading Day  Wall Street slogged through an uneven session, finishing mixed. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 21.97 points, to 10,459.63, the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index rose 1.26 points, to 1,221.59, and the Nasdaq composite index dropped 4.19 points, to 2,147.90.

Shiite and Kurdish leaders said they had run out of patience with the Sunni negotiators and sought to play down the importance of leaving them out, saying that with their Baathist links, they had never truly spoken for the broader Sunni community.

Safety Brian Dawkins leads an outstanding secondary, and the cornerbacks' ability to cover one on one enables the Eagles to blitz with abandon. Coach Andy Reid has established a standard of excellence. Anything less than a Super Bowl victory would be disappointing.  WEAKNESSES -- The contract disputes of Owens and running back Brian Westbrook, and the team's decision to allow defensive tackle Corey Simon to get away, threaten team unity like never before. McNabb lost one of his favorite targets, Todd Pinkston, to a season-ending injury (torn Achilles' tendon). The Eagles lack a power runner to pick up tough yardage inside. Their two-minute offense sometimes looks disorganized.  OUTLOOK -- This team remains the conference favorite and should win at least 10 games almost by simply showing up. The offense, defense and special teams are solid, and the Eagles have enough depth to cover for almost any injury -- except to McNabb or Owens. The N.F.C.'s road to the Super Bowl goes through Philadelphia.    2 Dallas (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Running back Julius Jones could have a breakout season as the featured back in Coach Bill Parcells's run-based offense. Tight end Jason Witten is a reliable target for quarterback Drew Bledsoe, and strong safety Roy Williams is a fierce tackler who can intimidate receivers. When the Cowboys stay in games until the fourth quarter, Parcells has proven he is still a master at conjuring a victory.  WEAKNESSES -- This team had a weak pass rush last year and yielded 405 points, uncharacteristic for a Parcells team. There will be many new starters on defense, but if the pass rush does not improve, a suspect secondary could be exposed, bringing a scowl to Parcells's face.  OUTLOOK -- The Cowboys will be better, but how much? Bledsoe has a great arm but the mobility of an oak tree. He will excel only if given time to throw. The switch to a 3-4 defense should suit their roster. The Cowboys play three of their first four games on the road, followed by a home game against the Eagles. If they start no worse than 2-3, they should make the playoffs.    3 Giants (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Tiki Barber is a superb all-purpose back, and defensive end Michael Strahan appears determined to prove he remains an impact player. Tight end Jeremy Shockey has the kind of downfield speed not often seen at his position. Amani Toomer and Plaxico Burress make an intriguing combination at wide receiver. The Giants also have a solid secondary.  WEAKNESSES -- The offense must improve. The Giants scored fewer than 20 points in 9 of 16 games last season, and the offensive line yielded 52 sacks. Quarterback Eli Manning will not improve much if he spends a lot of time on his back. The defense also needs to force more turnovers.  OUTLOOK -- The Giants will go as Manning goes. If he becomes a consistent quarterback, a .500 season is possible. If he struggles, the Giants do not have enough talent to carry him. Though Tom Coughlin is in only his second season as coach, he needs to prove that this franchise is on the upswing.    4 Washington  (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Clinton Portis is a consistent 1,000-yard back. LaVar Arrington is a difference-maker at linebacker when healthy, and Cornelius Griffin is a superb defensive tackle. Santana Moss is a dangerous punt returner and deep threat at receiver. The offensive line should be solid, featuring Chris Samuels and Casey Rabach.  WEAKNESSES -- Offensively, this team does not have enough playmakers. A quarterback controversy could be in the making, featuring Patrick Ramsey, Mark Brunell and Jason Campbell. The Redskins lost a lot of talent to free agency, including linebacker Antonio Pierce and cornerback Fred Smoot.  OUTLOOK -- Joe Gibbs got more of a challenge than he bargained for when he returned to coaching, and this season presents another challenge. Some expect the Redskins to bounce back, but there are too many question marks, like Arrington's health and Ramsey's suitability as a No. 1 quarterback. Look for another year under .500.    WEST    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- Seattle needed only nine victories to win this division last season, but Arizona looks improved, and St. Louis owned the Seahawks last season, beating them three times. The Seahawks have the most talent and must be considered the favorite. But none of these teams boast a reliable defense, meaning nobody from this division is going to the Super Bowl.    1 Seattle  (9-7)  STRENGTHS -- Matt Hasselbeck is a solid quarterback, hitting his prime as he nears 30. Looking for a bigger contract and running behind a good offensive line, Shaun Alexander will be motivated for another standout season. Strong safety Michael Boulware is by far the team's best defensive player. Place-kicker Josh Brown is reliable.    WEAKNESSES -- The defense is susceptible to big plays. The wide receivers drop too many passes. After a 3-0 start last season, the Seahawks went 6-7 the rest of the way, making them the worst team to make the playoffs. They can score points, but their defense also surrenders them.  OUTLOOK -- This team is capable of looking very good, or not so good. The talent of Hasselbeck and Alexander should be enough to lead the way to another division title. But if the Seahawks miss the playoffs or sustain another first-round knockout, Coach Mike Holmgren may have to pack his bags.    2 St. Louis (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- Running back Steven Jackson has blossomed as a starter and, at 22, could become a star. Marc Bulger is a good quarterback who is improving. Torry Holt is often overlooked when the best receivers are discussed, but he is an excellent player. The free-agent linebacker Dexter Coakley should help the defense.  WEAKNESSES -- Not enough upgrades were made to a defense that had problems. The Rams had nine games last season in which they surrendered at least 28 points, including their playoff loss to Atlanta. Stars like Marshall Faulk and Isaac Bruce are showing their age. Special teams have been a continuing problem.  OUTLOOK -- This team is in a slow decline. The core players are aging, and most of the younger players are unproven. If Bulger has a huge year, the Rams may have one division title left in them. But it is more likely that they will miss the playoffs and realize that the time has come to rebuild.    3 Arizona  (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Anquan Boldin and Larry Fitzgerald have the potential to become a top wide-receiver duo. Quarterback Kurt Warner has something to prove and remains an accurate passer when given time. The second-year coach Dennis Green has worked hard to change the losing culture in Arizona. The rookie back J.J. Arrington should help the ground game.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense, with a young secondary that could yield too many big plays, will not scare anyone. If the offensive line does not protect Warner, he will struggle and turn over the ball. This team will have many new faces in vital positions, and it could take time to jell.  OUTLOOK -- Arizona has had six consecutive losing seasons, and this team is likely to make it No. 7. Green is slowly upgrading the talent and cutting players who accept losing too easily. This is a weak division, so the Cardinals could finish close to .500. But they appear to be at least a year away from making a significant leap.    4 San Francisco (2-14)  STRENGTHS -- Julian Peterson is a mobile linebacker who is talented enough to anchor the 3-4 defense favored by Mike Nolan, the new coach. Ahmed Plummer's return from injury will strengthen the secondary. Defensive end Bryant Young is a veteran leader who remembers when the 49ers were good.  WEAKNESSES -- This was the worst team in the N.F.L. last season, and numerous holes remain. Alex Smith figures to struggle as a rookie quarterback, even if he displaces Tim Rattay as the starter. None of the running backs can keep defenses honest. The receiving corps is largely unproven, and the defense will bend and break.  OUTLOOK -- A rebuilding job has begun, with a new front office, a new coach and a new quarterback. The death of offensive lineman Thomas Herrion made it a sobering preseason. Considering they won just two games last season, the 49ers have an excellent chance to improve. But they should cherish each victory, because there may not be many of them.    NORTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- This one looks wide open. The Packers are older. The Lions have offensive talent. Nobody knows how the Vikings will fare without Randy Moss. And even the lowly Bears have a solid defense. Brett Favre's magic always makes the Packers dangerous, but another star quarterback, Daunte Culpepper, gives Minnesota the best chance to win this division.    1 Minnesota (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- After a brilliant year, Culpepper can take full leadership of the offense, now that Moss has been traded to Oakland. Nate Burleson and the rookie Troy Williamson are speedy targets for Culpepper. The defense should be improved, with the addition of the free agents Fred Smoot and Darren Sharper to the secondary. Kevin Williams is a standout defensive tackle.  WEAKNESSES -- The defense could still struggle against the run, especially if the linebackers remain mediocre. There is no consistent running game to take pressure off Culpepper. The Vikings will not miss Moss's mouth, but they will miss his big-play ability. Without a dominant defense, the Vikings could be exciting but inconsistent.  OUTLOOK -- There will be fewer distractions with Moss gone, and the Vikings still have more talent than any team in the division. Coach Mike Tice probably needs another playoff year to keep his job, and the team is motivated to prove it is better off without Moss. A 9- or 10-victory season seems likely.    2 Detroit (6-10)  STRENGTHS -- Roy Williams, Charles Rogers and Mike Williams will stretch the field as a dangerous receiving threesome. Kevin Jones, who rushed for 1,133 yards last season, is a potential star.  WEAKNESSES -- If Joey Harrington falters at quarterback, the backup will be the untested rookie Dan Orlovsky; Jeff Garcia, who is familiar with Coach Steve Mariucci's system, could miss the regular season after breaking his left leg in Friday's preseason finale against Buffalo. The defense remains unproven but must improve. Averaging four victories over the past four seasons, the Lions are used to losing, and that mentality can be difficult to overcome. The talent has been upgraded, but the roster is still short of depth.  OUTLOOK -- This is a make-or-break year for Harrington, who has been given enough offensive weapons to succeed. People forget that Detroit started 4-2 last year before a five-game losing streak ruined the season. The Lions are headed in the right direction, but they remain at least a year away from the playoffs.    3 Green Bay (10-6)  STRENGTHS -- Everything begins with Favre, who looks lean and hungry after a strenuous off-season workout program. He will lead a potent offense, throwing to Javon Walker and Donald Driver, or handing off to Ahman Green. This is an experienced team that does not panic. Favre gives it a chance to defeat anyone.  WEAKNESSES -- The Packers had a poor defense last season, and it does not appear to have been significantly upgraded. This is a team that could give up big plays while forcing few turnovers -- a bad combination. Coach Mike Sherman got the contract extension he was looking for, but what he really needs is a few stars on defense.  OUTLOOK -- Green Bay looks ripe for a fall, with aging offensive stars and a potentially porous defense. Favre is the primary reason the Packers won 10 games last season, but he may be asked to carry an even bigger load, and that is asking a lot. Another playoff year in Green Bay is unlikely.    4 Chicago  (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- The defense will keep the Bears in some games, especially when the weather turns ugly. Linebacker Brian Urlacher seems to have recovered from injuries -- bad news for quarterbacks. Defensive ends Alex Brown and Adewale Ogunleye are strong pass rushers. Wide receiver Muhsin Muhammad, acquired through free agency, gives Chicago a big-play target.  WEAKNESSES -- Quarterback Rex Grossman broke his ankle in preseason, leaving Kyle Orton, the rookie from Purdue, as the starter. The offensive line does not look impressive. Moving the football could be a serious problem, and Muhammad will probably see more double coverage than Shaquille O'Neal.  OUTLOOK -- You have heard of the Bad News Bears; these are the Bad Luck Bears. Grossman sustained a serious injury for the second consecutive season. They drafted a running back, Cedric Benson, with the No. 4 overall pick, but he held out longer than any first-round pick. It will be another dreary Chicago winter.    SOUTH    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- This could be the most competitive division in the league. Atlanta reached the N.F.C. championship game, the Saints and the Panthers just missed the playoffs, and Tampa Bay looks much improved. All of these teams think they can make the playoffs, and how they fare against one another will probably determine the division winner.    1 Tampa Bay (5-11)  STRENGTHS -- The defense looks formidable, led by linebacker Derrick Brooks, defensive end Simeon Rice and two of the game's best cornerbacks, Ronde Barber and Brian Kelly. Michael Clayton is a budding star at wide receiver, and the first-round draft pick Carnell Williams is a versatile threat at running back. Quarterback Brian Griese is coming off his best year.  WEAKNESSES -- This team has underachieved for two seasons. Perhaps some players have tuned out Coach Jon Gruden. Nobody has filled the leadership void left when John Lynch and Warren Sapp departed. Tampa Bay does not have a big-play offense and has been a poor come-from-behind team.  OUTLOOK -- In this age of parity and free agency, at least one N.F.L. team always has a huge turnaround. Tampa Bay could be that team. Much will hinge on the play of Griese, who must avoid interceptions. The Buccaneers have enough talent to double last year's victory total and make a surprise entry into the playoffs.    2 Carolina  (7-9)  STRENGTHS -- The defensive line of Julius Peppers, Kris Jenkins, Brentson Buckner and Mike Rucker could be the N.F.L.'s best. Jake Delhomme is not a flashy quarterback, but he is effective. John Fox is an excellent coach, able to keep his team motivated last season despite a 1-7 start and numerous injuries. Few teams play harder as consistently.  WEAKNESSES -- There are questions at running back, with the injury-prone Stephen Davis, DeShaun Foster and Nick Goings splitting time. Muhsin Muhammad will be missed, putting more pressure on Steve Smith, the team's top receiver, who is coming off a broken leg. If the running game is inconsistent, the Panthers may lose some close low-scoring games.  OUTLOOK -- The Panthers could win this division, or even reach the Super Bowl. Or they could miss the playoffs. They figure to have better luck with injuries than they did last season, so expect them to have a winning season. Fox's teams usually play their best in the second half of the season.    3New Orleans  (8-8)  STRENGTHS -- Joe Horn is a dangerous receiver who gets open consistently and runs well after the catch. The rookie Jammal Brown will bolster the offensive line. Deuce McAllister is a back with the power to run inside and the speed to break long runs. Ending 2004 with a four-game winning streak has this team entering the season with optimism.  WEAKNESSES -- Aaron Brooks puts up big numbers at quarterback, but he throws too many interceptions. Teams can run on the Saints and keep their potent offense off the field.  OUTLOOK -- The wild card is how the team deals with the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina. No other team comes close to having the same handicap. As usual, the Saints will probably look better on paper than on the field. They were 4-8 after 12 games last season, and only their late-season rally saved Coach Jim Haslett's job. If Brooks plays with more consistency, the Saints could be playoff bound. If not, Haslett will most likely be looking for a job and the Saints may look to rebuild.    4 Atlanta  (11-5)  STRENGTHS -- Michael Vick is the N.F.L.'s most electrifying player, able to turn any play into a touchdown. Alge Crumpler gives the Falcons a pass-catching threat at tight end, and defensive tackle Rod Coleman anchors a strong front. The Falcons are a physical team, with sure tacklers, hard hitters and defensive speed.  WEAKNESSES -- The reliance on Vick is so heavy that the Falcons will plummet if he misses significant time or if he plays inconsistently. Peerless Price was a bust, and the Falcons still do not have a big-play receiver. Atlanta has a difficult schedule, with five of its first seven games against teams that made the playoffs last season.  OUTLOOK -- Everything points to this team taking a fall. The Falcons have never had back-to-back winning seasons, their schedule is tough and their division is stronger. Coach Jim Mora had an excellent first season and may need another excellent one just to have the Falcons make the playoffs.",https://www.nytimes.com/2005/09/04/sports/pro-football-nfc-scouting-reports.html,"EAST    KEY TO WINNING DIVISION -- The Eagles were 6-0 against teams in their division last season and won their fourth consecutive N.F.C.

Vineyard Theater, 108 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)353-0303.    Broadway    'ALL SHOOK UP' In a pint-size theater with a campy young cast, this might be a moderate hoot. Inflated to Broadway proportions, it's a mind-numbing holler (2:10). Palace Theater, 1564 Broadway, at 47th Street, (212)307-4100.(Ben Brantley)    'CHITTY CHITTY BANG BANG' The playthings are the thing in this lavish windup music box of a show: windmills, Rube Goldberg-esque machines and the show's title character, a flying car. It's like spending two and a half hours in the Times Square branch of Toys ''R'' Us (2:30). Hilton Theater, 213 West 42nd Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    'DIRTY ROTTEN SCOUNDRELS' On paper this musical tale of two mismatched scam artists has an awful lot in common with ''The Producers.'' But if you are going to court comparison with giants, you had better be prepared to stand tall. ''Dirty Rotten Scoundrels,'' starring John Lithgow and Norbert Leo Butz, never straightens out of a slouch (2:35). Imperial Theater, 249 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'DOUBT, A PARABLE' (Pulitzer Prize, Best Play 2005, and Tony Award, Best Play 2005) Set in the Bronx in 1964, this play by John Patrick Shanley is structured as a clash of wills and generations between Sister Aloysius (Cherry Jones), the head of a parochial school, and Father Flynn (Brian F. O'Byrne), the young priest who may or may not be too fond of the boys in his charge. The play's elements bring to mind those tidy topical melodramas that were once so popular. But Mr. Shanley makes subversive use of musty conventions (1:30). Walter Kerr, 219 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'LENNON' In the immortal words of Yoko Ono, ''Aieeeee!'' (2:10). Broadhurst Theater, 235 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'THE LIGHT IN THE PIAZZA' Love is a many-flavored thing, from sugary to sour, in Adam Guettel and Craig Lucas's encouragingly ambitious and discouragingly unfulfilled new musical. The show soars only in the sweetly bitter songs performed by the wonderful Victoria Clark, as an American abroad (2:15). Beaumont Theater, Lincoln Center, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE PILLOWMAN' For all its darkness of plot and imagery, Martin McDonagh's tale of a suspected child murderer in a totalitarian state dazzles with a brightness now largely absent from Broadway. Exquisitely directed and designed, ''The Pillowman'' features top-of-the-line performances from Billy Crudup, Jeff Goldblum, Zeljko Ivanek and Michael Stuhlbarg (2:40). Booth Theater, 222 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SPAMALOT' (Tony Award, Best Musical 2005) This staged re-creation of the mock-medieval movie ''Monty Python and the Holy Grail'' is basically a singing scrapbook for Python fans. Still, it seems safe to say that such a good time is being had by so many people that this fitful, eager celebration of inanity and irreverence will find a large and lucrative audience (2:20). Shubert Theater, 225 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'SWEET CHARITY' This revival of the 1966 musical never achieves more than a low-grade fever when what's wanted is that old steam heat. In the title role of the hopeful dance-hall hostess, the appealing but underequipped Christina Applegate is less a shopworn angel than a merry cherub (2:30). Al Hirschfeld Theater, 302 West 45th Street, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    *'THE 25TH ANNUAL PUTNAM COUNTY SPELLING BEE' The happy news for this happy-making little musical is that the move to larger quarters has dissipated none of its quirky charm. William Finn's score sounds plumper and more rewarding than it did Off Broadway, providing a sprinkling of sugar to complement the sass in Rachel Sheinkin's zinger-filled book. The performances are flawless. Gold stars all around. (1:45). Circle in the Square, 1633 Broadway, at 50th Street, (212)239-6200. (Charles Isherwood)    Off Broadway    *'ALTAR BOYZ' This sweetly satirical show about a Christian pop group made up of five potential Teen People cover boys is an enjoyable, silly diversion (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 4, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'DEDICATION, OR THE STUFF OF DREAMS' Portraying a terminally ill, rancidly rich misanthrope in Terrence McNally's play about a small-town children's theater troupe, Marian Seldes is a snappy advertisement for the time-defying benefits of a religious devotion to theater. She is, in fact, what ''Dedication'' is all about, or intends to be, anyway. Burdened with soap-opera-ish plot turns and artificially bright dialogue, this comedy of mortality never seems able to convince itself that life and art trump death and doubt, despite the presence of a top-flight cast led by Nathan Lane (2:15). Beginning Tuesday, Don Amendolia replaces Mr. Lane. 59E59 Theaters, 59 East 59th Street, Manhattan, (212)279-4200. (Brantley)    'DRUMSTRUCK' This noisy novelty is a mixed blessing. Providing a two-foot drum on every seat, it offers an opportunity to exorcise aggressions by delivering a good beating, and on a slightly more elevated level, it presents a superficial introduction to African culture, lessons in drumming and 90 minutes of nonstop music, song and dancing by a good-natured cast. So, while literally and figuratively giving off many good vibes, it adds up to lightweight entertainment that stops just short of pulverizing the eardrums (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 2, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200.(Lawrence Van Gelder)    * 'FORBIDDEN BROADWAY: SPECIAL VICTIMS UNIT' This production features the expected caricatures of ego-driven singing stars. But even more than usual, the show offers an acute list of grievances about the sickly state of the Broadway musical, where, as the lyrics have it, ''everything old is old again'' (1:45). 47th Street Theater, 304 West 47th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    'JOY' John Fisher's play with music, a lecture-prone valentine to San Francisco and gay life among college students, says less about human sexuality and longing than the classic, melancholy love songs the cast performs (2:00). The Actors' Playhouse, 100 Seventh Avenue South, at Fourth Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Andrea Stevens)    'THE MUSICAL OF MUSICALS!' The musical is the happy narcissist of theater; parody is the best form of narcissism. All it needs are smart writers and winning performers. That's what we get in this case (1:30). Dodger Stages, Stage 5, 340 West 50th Street, Clinton, (212)239-6200. (Margo Jefferson)    *'ORSON'S SHADOW' Austin Pendleton's play, about a 1960 production of Ionesco's ''Rhinoceros,'' which was directed by Orson Welles and starred Laurence Olivier, is a sharp-witted but tenderhearted backstage comedy about the thin skins, inflamed nerves and rampaging egos that are the customary side effects when sensitivity meets success (2:00). Barrow Street Theater, 27 Barrow Street, Greenwich Village, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'ONCE AROUND THE SUN' The ''sun'' of the title could be the talent and energy of its impressive cast: you can warm your hands on them and on the catchy music. Unfortunately the book fails to capitalize on these strengths, instead presenting a trite fable about a young rock singer seduced by celebrity, with cardboard characters despite the actors' best efforts to give them dimension. Still, the performances are very entertaining (2:00). Zipper Theater, 336 West 37th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Anne Midgette)    'ONE-MAN STAR WARS TRILOGY' With a storm trooper roaming the aisles and a woman in an Obi-Wan Kenobi get-up telling theatergoers to turn off their cellphones or they will be turned into ''cosmic dust,'' Charles Ross's sprint in Episodes IV through VI aims for the atmosphere of a ''Star Wars'' convention but ends up achieving something like a religious revival (which is sort of the same thing). True believers will love how Mr. Ross, a self-confessed geek who plays every major role in under an hour, simulates R2D2, but everyone else will scratch his head (1:00). Lamb's Theater, 130 West 44th Street, Manhattan, (212)239-6200. (Jason Zinoman)    'PHILADELPHIA, HERE I COME!' Ciaran O'Reilly's small but spirited production of Brian Friel's mournful, funny 1964 play centers on a lonely young man preparing to flee the small-minded Irish backwater he grew up in for the big time in the U.S. of A. Michael FitzGerald and James Kennedy are nicely contrasted as the public and private faces of a man at a painful crossroads (2:20). Irish Repertory Theater, 132 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)727-2737. (Isherwood)    *'SIDES: THE FEAR IS REAL' This hilarious collection of sketches may send up familiar targets -- the insecure thespian, the fraudulent acting teacher, the arrogant Juilliard grad -- but since it's performed with such specificity and comic charm by actors firing on all cylinders, you won't care a whit. Written by and starring an all-Asian-American cast, this slight but consistently entertaining satire is a primer on what not to do in an audition room (1:15). Culture Project, 45 Bleecker Street, at Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)307-4100. (Zinoman)    *'THOM PAIN (BASED ON NOTHING)' Is there such a thing as stand-up existentialism? If not, Will Eno has just invented it. Stand-up-style comic riffs and deadpan hipster banter keep interrupting the corrosively bleak narrative. Mr. Eno is a Samuel Beckett for the Jon Stewart generation (1:10). DR2 Theater, 103 East 15th Street, Flatiron district, (212)239-6200. (Isherwood)    'TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA' Three decades after it first charmed critics with its insouciance, John Guare and Mel Shapiro's adaptation of Shakespeare's comedy, with throwaway songs by Galt MacDermot, tastes less like vintage Champagne than a fruity sangria. But isn't sangria the right drink for a sultry night in the park? Directed and choreographed by Kathleen Marshall, with a peppy young cast that includes the ravishing Rosario Dawson (2:45). The Public Theater at the Delacorte Theater, Central Park, entrances at 81st Street and Central Park West, and at 79th Street and Fifth Avenue, (212)239-6200. (Brantley)    Off Off Broadway    'SCREEN PLAY' A.R. Gurney's gleefully partisan retooling of the film ''Casablanca'' sets one tough saloon owner's battle between idealism and cynicism in Buffalo in the 21st century. Staged by Jim Simpson as a deftly orchestrated reading, ''Screen Play'' turns out to be more than a quick collegiate caper; it's a morally indignant work that fights frivolity with frivolity (1:10). Flea Theater, 41 White Street, TriBeCa, (212)352-3101. Reopening Thursday. (Brantley)    Long-Running Shows    'AVENUE Q' R-rated puppets give lively life lessons (2:10).

Union Square Theater, 100 East 17th Street, (212)307-4100. (Van Gelder)    'STOMP' And the beat goes on (and on), with percussion unlimited (1:30). Orpheum Theater, Second Avenue at Eighth Street, East Village, (212)477-2477. (Brantley)    'WICKED' Oz revisited, with political corrections (2:45). Gershwin Theater, 222 West 51st Street, (212)307-4100. (Brantley)    Last Chance    'JACKIE MASON: FRESHLY SQUEEZED' Mr. Mason has so cunningly manufactured and marketed his dyspeptic comic persona -- the herky-jerky movements used to embellish the routines, the voice that's like a sinus infection with a bad back -- that he may soon be able to refine all actual jokes out of his act and still slay 'em. That's chutzpah. And quite a talent, too (2:05). Helen Hayes Theater, 240 West 44th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Isherwood)    *'WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?'  Everybody ultimately loses in Edward Albee's great marital wrestling match of a play from 1962. But theatergoers who attend this revealingly acted new production, starring a superb Kathleen Turner and Bill Irwin, are destined to leave the show feeling like winners (2:50). Longacre Theater, 220 West 48th Street, (212)239-6200, closing on Sunday. (Brantley)    Movies    Ratings and running times are in parentheses; foreign films have English subtitles. Full reviews of all current releases, movie trailers, showtimes and tickets: nytimes.com/movies. (An article on summer films is on Page 1 of Weekend.)    *'THE ARISTOCRATS' (No rating, 89 minutes) A rigorously scholarly documentary about the theory and practice of joke-telling that also happens to be one of the filthiest, vilest, most extravagantly obscene movies ever made -- and one of the funniest. (A.O. Scott)    'ASYLUM' (R, 90 minutes) A dreary, claustrophobic soap with Natasha Richardson about a 1950's bored wife and mother victimized by her times and her incredibly bad taste in men; based on Patrick McGrath's novel and directed by David Mackenzie. (Manohla Dargis)    *'BAD NEWS BEARS' (PG-13, 111 minutes) Filled with small, cute kids and large, goofy laughs and kept aloft by Billy Bob Thornton's ribald star turn, Richard Linklater's remake of this 1976 sports comedy won't rock your movie world. But the fact that the filmmaker keeps the freak flag flying in the face of our culture of triumphalism is a thing of beauty. (Dargis)    'BALZAC AND THE LITTLE CHINESE SEAMSTRESS' (No rating, 111 minutes, in Mandarin and French) Dai Sijie, adapting his novel, looks back at the Chinese Cultural Revolution, relating a touching, bittersweet love story that is also a testament to the power of literature in times of political repression. (Scott)    *'BATMAN BEGINS' (PG-13, 137 minutes) Conceived in the shadow of American pop rather than in its bright light, this tense, effective iteration of Bob Kane's original comic book owes its power and pleasures to a director (Christopher Nolan) who takes his material seriously and to a star (a terrific Christian Bale) who shoulders that seriousness with ease. ''Batman Begins'' is the seventh live-action film to take on the comic-book legend and the first to usher it into the kingdom of movie myth. (Dargis)    'THE BAXTER' (PG-13, 91 minutes) A ''Baxter,'' in the lingo of this romantic comedy written by, directed by and starring the comedian Michael Showalter, is the safe choice, the also-ran, the guy who gets left at the altar when the hero shows up, as Dustin Hoffman did in ''The Graduate,'' to claim his true love. The film's tragic flaw is that Mr. Showalter is miscast -- or has miscast himself -- in the title role. In the end, ''The Baxter'' is a Baxter of a movie: well meaning and mildly likable, but unlikely to sweep you off your feet. (Dana Stevens)    'BEWITCHED'(PG-13, 90 minutes) Nicole Kidman stars as a real nose-twitching witch cast in a sitcom redo of ''Bewitched.'' The movie is agreeably watchable for an hour, so it's too bad that the director, Nora Ephron, forgot that a gimmick is no substitute for a screenplay, never mind a real movie. (Dargis)    * 'BROKEN FLOWERS' (R, 105 minutes) Sweet, funny, sad and meandering, Jim Jarmusch's new film sends Bill Murray's aging Don Juan out in search of a son he never knew he had. He finds four former lovers, including Sharon Stone and Jessica Lange, and reveals once again that he is the quietest and finest comic actor working in movies today. (Scott)    'THE BROTHERS GRIMM' (PG-13, 118 minutes) Despite a few early sparks of promise, Terry Gilliam's big-screen adventure about the brother folklorists (played by Matt Damon and Heath Ledger) sputters and coughs along like an unoiled machine, grinding gears and nerves in equal measure. (Dargis)    'THE CAVE' (PG-13, 97 minutes) In Bruce Hunt's formulaic ''The Cave,'' a group of ace cave-divers are flown in to investigate an intricate maze system discovered beneath the ruins of an ancient Romanian abbey, but instead become the prey of mutated demonlike creatures that can fly and see in the dark. Dreadfully dull, muddled and chaotic, with colorless and underdeveloped characters.(Laura Kern)    'THE CENTURY OF THE SELF' (No rating, four hours, shown in two parts) This documentary, a four-part series produced for BBC television that is being shown in theaters in two separate two-hour segments, explores how Freud's seminal theory of the subconscious has been successfully deployed over the past century as an instrument of consumer manipulation and social control. ''The Century of the Self'' is an unusually cerebral filmed essay that demands focus and patience from its audience as it sets about unearthing a secret history of the 20th century. (Stevens)    'CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY' (PG, 116 minutes) Flawed but fascinating. Some of the departures from the book will make Roald Dahl fans roll their eyes, but some of the visuals will make their eyes (and everyone else's) pop. (Scott)    *'DARWIN'S NIGHTMARE' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English, Russian and Swahili) A harrowing, unblinking look at the consequences of globalization, as seen from the shores of Lake Victoria in Tanzania. Not easy viewing, but indispensable for just that reason. (Scott)    'DEUCE BIGALOW: EUROPEAN GIGOLO' (R, 77 minutes) In a sequel to the 1999 hit, the schlubby escort lands in Amsterdam to make lovelorn ladies feel whole, but the entire ordeal is mockery disguised as self-help. The insulting comedy is out of step with the culture, the times and the rebranded Adam Sandler, who was a producer and bit player in this mess. (Ned Martel)    *'EL CRIMEN PERFECTO' (No rating, 105 minutes, in Spanish) In this antic and outrageous black comedy, Rafael González (Guillermo Toledo) is a salesman in the women's section of a Madrid department store. Rafael's fondest dream is to be floor manager; when his archrival for the position, Don Antonio (Luis Varela), is accidentally killed in a scuffle in the dressing room, Rafael's world begins to unravel. Like the Ferris wheel that serves as the setting for one of its climactic scenes, ''El Crimen Perfecto'' is a bright, gaudy and tremendously satisfying ride. (Stevens)    'ETERNAL' (No rating, 108 minutes) Lush, lurid, and completely besotted with itself, ''Eternal'' claims inspiration from the life of Erszebet Bathory, a 16th-century Hungarian countess whose antiaging routine required frequent immersions in young, female blood. Merging low art and high production values, this is one of the dullest, least sexy lesbian vampire movies ever made. (Jeannette Catsoulis)    'FANTASTIC FOUR' (PG-13, 105 minutes) Mediocre at best. (Scott)    'FORMULA 17' (No rating, 93 minutes, in Mandarin) A silly-sweet gay romantic comedy aimed primarily at teenagers and college-age audiences, this tale of a virginal young man who finds love in Taipei is charmingly cosmopolitan. Though it is rife with stereotypes, the movie's breeziness and bouyant good humor are difficult to resist. (Catsoulis)    *'THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN' (R, 111 minutes) A sex comedy turned romantic bliss-out with Steve Carell in which the sound of one prophylactic snapping is just a single sweet note in the glorious symphony of love. (Dargis)    'FOUR BROTHERS' (R, 148 minutes) In John Singleton's slick hybrid of urban western and modern blaxploitation movie, four young men, two black and two white, reunite in Detroit to avenge the shooting death of their saintly adoptive mother. Preposterous, amoral and exciting. (Stephen Holden)    *'THE GOEBBELS EXPERIMENT' (No rating, 107 minutes, in English and German) Lutz Hachmeister and Michael Kloft's fascinating documentary provides a chilling glimpse into the brilliant but toxic mind of Joseph Goebbels via his extensive diaries. From soggy sentimentality to maniacal extermination fantasies, the entries reveal a supremely theatrical man whose manipulation of mass political opinion was unprecedented. (Catsoulis)    'THE GREAT RAID' (R, 132 minutes) This tedious World War II movie, which re-enacts a real-life heroic rescue of American prisoners from a Japanese camp in the Philippines, slogs across the screen like a forced march in quicksand. (Holden)    *'GRIZZLY MAN' (R, 103 minutes) Werner Herzog's bold, enthralling documentary about one man's journey into the heart of darkness (and the belly of the beast) traces the life and strange times of the self-anointed grizzly expert Timothy Treadwell. (Dargis)    'HUSTLE & FLOW' (R, 114 minutes) Terrence Howard is superb as a Memphis pimp chasing his dream of hip-hop stardom in a movie that is an awkward mix of realism, misogyny and Hollywood hokum. (Scott)    * 'JUNEBUG' (R, 107 minutes) A Southern ''Five Easy Pieces,'' this deep, bittersweet comedy about a young man's return from Chicago to his family's North Carolina home envelops us in the texture of a culture the movies seldom visit. Amy Adams gives an incandescent portrayal of the man's pregnant, childlike sister-in-law. (Holden)    * 'LAST DAYS' (R, 97 minutes) An impressionistic portrait, ''Last Days'' is in many ways less about the death of Kurt Cobain than about the resurrection of Gus Van Sant, even as it is also about the mystery of human consciousness, the ecstasy of creation, and how sorrow sometimes goes hand in hand with the sublime. (Dargis)    'MAD HOT BALLROOM' (PG, 105 minutes) This documentary follows fifth graders from three very different New York City public schools as they prepare to compete in a ballroom dancing tournament. The sight of 10-year-olds trying to master the graceful, grown-up motions of the fox trot and the tango is charming, and the glimpses of their lives in and outside of school are fascinating, though unfortunately the film offers little more than glimpses. (Scott)    *'MARCH OF THE PENGUINS' (G, 80 minutes) This sentimental but riveting documentary follows the one-year mating cycle of emperor penguins in Antarctica when they leave the ocean and march inland to breed and lay eggs. Narrated by Morgan Freeman, the film has no qualms about playing on our emotions. (Holden)    *'THE MEMORY OF A KILLER' (R, 120 minutes, in Flemish and French) Directed by Erik Van Looy, this nicely kinked Belgian thriller features a range of good guys and bad, including one whose sense of morality and world-weariness seem straight out of a Jean-Pierre Melville film. (Dargis)    'MR. AND MRS. SMITH' (PG-13, 112 minutes) What counts in a movie like this are stars so dazzling that we won't really notice or at least mind the cut-rate writing (from Simon Kinberg) and occasionally incoherent action (from the director, Doug Liman). Sometimes Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie succeed in their mutual role as sucker bait, sometimes they don't, which is why their joint venture is alternately a goof and a drag. (Dargis)    *'MURDERBALL' (R, 86 minutes) The brutal, highly competitive sport of wheelchair rugby is the subject of this exciting and uplifting (but never mawkish) documentary about the redemptive power of fierce athletic competition. (Holden)    'MUST LOVE DOGS' (PG-13, 92 minutes) This tepid sitcom about computer dating wastes the talents of its stars (Diane Lane, John Cusack, Christopher Plummer, Stockard Channing) in stale, dated material that makes Nora Ephron's trifles look like Chekhov. (Holden)    '9 SONGS' (No rating, 69 minutes) Graphically photographed scenes of an attractive young couple having real, not simulated, sex are interwoven with concert performances of rock songs played by various bands. The couplings reveal little about who these people are. (Holden)    *'PRETTY PERSUASION' (No rating, 104 minutes) In this go-for-broke satire, Evan Rachel Wood plays a toxic 15-year-old alpha girl who joins with two sidekicks from her private Beverly Hills high school to falsely accuse their English and drama teacher of sexual harassment. Very funny and very nasty. (Holden)    * 'RED EYE' (PG-13, 85 minutes) The sights and sounds of two people talking become a nerve-jangling duet for cat and mouse, hunter and prey in Wes Craven's nifty, tense thriller. (Dargis)    *'SECUESTRO EXPRESS' (R, 86 minutes, in Spanish) This is a relentless assault on the senses about three hoodlums who kidnap an attractive young couple, Carla (Mia Maestro) and Martin (Jean Paul), who then must face a hellish endurance test while awaiting the ransom money. This perfectly cast film is more than just a dizzying thrill ride laced with small doses of pitch-black comic relief; it also raises awareness of frightening real-life class wars and deep-rooted corruption in Caracas, Venezuela. (Kern)    'THE SKELETON KEY' (PG-13, 104 minutes) Kate Hudson in a T-shirt and underwear, intimations of unspeakable evil, slamming doors and equally slamming edits, and an introductory course in hoodoo, a folk religion born in the South -- all this and Gena Rowlands, Peter Sarsgaard and John Hurt, too. (Dargis)    * 'SKY HIGH' (PG, 102 minutes) This witty Disney adventure comedy imagines a high school for superheroes, hidden above the clouds, where the students are divided into Heroes and Sidekicks. The movie poses the age-old question ''Is there life after high school?'' and with a cheerful wink answers, ''No, not really.'' (Holden)    'SYMPATHY FOR MR. VENGEANCE' (No rating, 121 minutes) In this exploitation flick from Park Chanwook about two men who each set a course for bloody vengeance, the violence carries no meaning beyond the director's ego. (Dargis)    *'TONY TAKITANI' (No rating, 75 minutes, in Japanese) In this delicate wisp of a film with a surprisingly sharp sting, a lonely man awakens at 37 to life for the first time during a brief idyll. Directed by Jun Ichikawa, from a short story by Haruki Murakami. (Dargis)    * '2046' (R, 129 minutes) An ecstatically beautiful story in which time is marked not by the hands of a clock, but by the women who pass through one man's life, ''2046'' is the eighth feature film from the Hong Kong director Wong Kar-wai and the long-awaited follow-up to his art-house favorite ''In the Mood for Love.'' A film about longing, loss and the delicate curve of a woman's back, it is also an unqualified triumph. (Dargis)    'UNDISCOVERED' (PG-13, 97 minutes) A lifeless Los Angeles romance between an aspiring musician and a model is characterized by bland stars and overlong musical numbers. Set among a group of young people who dream of becoming famous, the picture carries more than a whiff of the self-referential. (Catsoulis)    'THE UNTOLD STORY OF EMMETT LOUIS TILL' (No rating, 70 minutes) Keith A. Beauchamp's lean, harrowing documentary about the 50-year-old murder that catalyzed the civil rights movement offers new evidence that the crime was a broader conspiracy than originally thought. (Holden)    'VALIANT' (G, 80 minutes) Homing pigeons versus falcons are the combatants in this shoddily made animated movie about heroes and villains in World War II. The talents of many fine British actors are squandered in the voice-overs. (Holden)    * 'WALL (MUR)' (No rating, 96 minutes, in Arabic and Hebrew) The filmmaker Simone Bitton takes a measured look at the barrier that divides Israel from the West Bank in this documentary, a film that considers hard-core political realities alongside agonizing personal truths. (Dargis)    'WAR OF THE WORLDS' (PG-13, 117 minutes) The aliens invade (again). Effectively scary and visually impressive. (Scott)    'WEDDING CRASHERS' (R, 113 minutes) A wink-wink, nudge-nudge Trojan horse of a story, this amiably raunchy sex comedy pivots on two Lotharios persuasively inhabited by Owen Wilson and Vince Vaughn. They love the ladies but really and truly, cross their cheating hearts, just want a nice girl to call wife. Credited to the screenwriters Steve Faber and Bob Fisher. (Dargis)    Film Series    A DAY IN THE LIFE OF NEW YORK (Through Wednesday, then an encore on Sept. 11) The Two Boots Pioneer Theater presents a weeklong run of Richard Karz's documentary about the second anniversary of the World Trade Center attacks. New Yorkers who share their thoughts and opinions on that day include Raymond W. Kelly, the police commissioner; Russell Simmons, the hip-hop mogul; Joe Torre, the Yankees manager; the Rev. Al Sharpton; Shirin Neshat, an Iranian-born artist and filmmaker; Dolly Lenz, a real estate broker; and Ti-Hua Chang, a local television news reporter. 155 East Third Street, at Avenue A, (212)591-0434, $9. (Anita Gates)    REPERTORY NIGHTS (Through Nov. 6) The Museum of the Moving Image continues its annual film series with a Godard double feature. ''Breathless'' (1959), which defined nouvelle vague; and his first big-star feature, ''Contempt'' (1963), with Brigitte Bardot. Both films are to be shown on Saturday and Sunday. Other auteurs in the festival will include Ingmar Bergman, F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick and François Truffaut. 35th Avenue at 36th Street, Astoria, Queens, (718)784-0077, $10. (Gates)    SUMMER SAMURAI (Through Sept. 15) Film Forum continues its four-week celebration of the Japanese warrior-action genre with Kihichi Okamoto's ''Kill!'' (1968), a genre blend (action, comedy and drama) about a samurai ordered to assassinate his best friend, and Masaki Kobayashi's ''Harakiri'' (1962), a drama about unemployed samurai in 17th-century peacetime. Other films in the festival include Akira Kurosawa's ''Seven Samurai'' (1964), ''Yojimbo'' (1961) and ''Throne of Blood'' (1957); and Okamoto's ''Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo'' (1970). 209 West Houston Street, (212)727-8110, $10. (Gates)    TRUTH AND DARE: NEW YORK KOREAN FILM FESTIVAL (Through Sept. 11) BAMcinématek's festival of recent films from Korea, now in its fifth year, begins today. This weekend's features include Chu Chang-Min's ''Mapado: All About the Hemp & Widows'' (2005), a comedy about a stolen Lotto jackpot and five lonely women, and Choi Dong-Hoon's bank heist film, ''The Big Swindle'' (2004). Today through Tuesday, Lighthouse Theater, 111 East 59th Street, (866)468-7619, $10. On Wednesday, the festival moves to BAM Rose Cinemas, 30 Lafayette Avenue, Fort Greene, Brooklyn, (718)636-4100, $10. (Gates)    Pop    Full reviews of recent concerts: nytimes.com/music.    MARC ANTHONY, ALEJANDRO FERNÁNDEZ (Tomorrow) Mr. Anthony is the biggest-selling salsa artist of all time, and is still passionately riding the rhythm as well as reportedly coaching his new wife, Jennifer Lopez, on the finer points of full-bodied singing. Mr. Fernández, the Mexican crooner, sings sweeping love ballads as well as mariachi standards. 7 p.m., Jones Beach Theater, 1000 Ocean Parkway, Wantagh, N.Y., (516)221-1000, $40 to $95. (Laura Sinagra)    ASYLUM STREET SPANKERS (Sunday) Jumpy, gypsified jazz of a Creole variety forms the repertory of this energetic Austin band, which slides easily from cabaret ragtime to hammy heartbreakers. 7 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $15 in advance, $18. (Sinagra)    BENVENUTO RUSSO DUO, DRUMS & TUBA (Thursday) The jam duo of Joe Russo and Marco Benvenuto plays jazz-inflected rock that dabbles in electronics. Drums & Tuba, an eclectic trio, explores a mix of groovy jazz-rock and brass band music; Brian Wolff plays tuba, trumpet and trombone. 8 p.m., Bowery Ballroom, 6 Delancey Street, Lower East Side, (212)533-2111, $15 in advance, $18. (Sinagra)    BLOOD ON THE WALL (Thursday) This shaggy Brooklyn trio fronted by the guitarist and vocalist Brad Shanks and his sister, the bassist and vocalist Courtney Shanks, make hip-shaking rock with a touch of Midwestern-gothic twang. 9 p.m., Cake Shop, 152 Ludlow Street, Lower East Side, (212)253-0036, $7. (Sinagra)    BROOKLYN JUNKYARD ROCK FESTIVAL (Tomorrow) The fourth installment of this annual outdoor rock show features performances by the angelic, experimental rockers Telepathy, the Utah electronica duo Fireball, the drum-pummeling noise duo Hospitals and the machine-beat, feedback-heavy Ex-Models. The arty pop buzz band the Double and the squalling rockers Oneida headline. Noon, South Fifth Street, between Berry Street and Wythe Avenue, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, free. (Sinagra)    CKY (Tuesday) The alt-metal band, whose initials stand for Camp Kill Yourself, saw its career take off when the drummer Jesse Margera's brother and skateboarder, Bam Margera, put the band in popular skate videos. 7 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $20 in advance, $22. (Sinagra)    MARIA DE BARROS (Tonight) Born in Senegal but raised in Mauritania and Rhode Island, Ms. De Barros sings in the style of the Cape Verdean Cesaria Evora. She sings in Spanish and the Portuguese-African dialect kriolu, mining her inherited island traditions, from the upbeat ''coladeira,'' a salsalike style, to soulful mornas and tricky funanas. 9:30 p.m., Joe's Pub, 425 Lafayette Street, East Village, (212)539-8770, $20. (Sinagra)    EVERY TIME I DIE, HIGH ON FIRE (Thursday) The screaming metal of Every Time I Die recalls the druggy melodies of Jane's Addiction, but it barrels along with speedier guitars and less preening. The underground dark metal High on Fire, whose recent work with the producer Steve Albini highlights its precision, is also on the bill. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $16. (Sinagra)    'FASHION ROCKS' (Thursday) This Fashion Week show will feature quick-hit performances by clotheshorses like Gwen Stefani, Joss Stone, Nelly, Alicia Keys, Tim McGraw, David Bowie, Duran Duran, Rob Thomas and the man whose look Brad Pitt stole, Billy Idol. The show, which will be broadcast on CBS the next night is supposedly the final TV gig for Destiny's Child, but the most interesting bits should come courtesy of the quirky Shakira and the theater-nerd indie rocker Arcade Fire. 8 p.m., Radio City Music Hall, (212)632-4000, $70. (Sinagra)    DIAMANDA GALAS (Thursday) There are no small emotions for Ms. Galas, whose compositions are music theater with its rawest nerves exposed. She takes up fear and rage, mourning and vengeance; her voice can reach operatic heights or slice through a room with primal moans and shrieks and sobs. This is the East Coast debut of ''Defixiones, Orders from the Dead,'' a ''sacred operatic mass.'' Thursday at 8 p.m., Pace University, Michael Schimmel Center for the Arts, 3 Spruce Street, Lower Manhattan, (212)279-4200, $15 to $35.

(Pareles)    IDLEWILD (Wednesday) The Scottish romantic Roddy Woomble's passionate, lyrical emo-punk band Idlewild delivers a reliably lovelorn brand of dejection that when it works right, proffers a winsomely broken narcissism. 8 p.m., Irving Plaza, 17 Irving Place, Union Square, (212)777-6800, $16. (Sinagra)    JANDEK (Tuesday) After 25 years in which he has released 40 wrenching, at times distressing, albums under the cover of shadowy anonymity, the interview-eschewing Texan musician known as Jandek has recently emerged to perform live for admirers who have long fetishized his songs, which veer from the eschatological to the whispery and sublingual, from claustrophobic to cracked. 7 p.m., Anthology Film Archives, 32 Second Avenue, East Village, $25 (sold out).

(Pareles)    THE NATIONAL, CLAP YOUR HANDS SAY YEAH (Thursday) The National is a group of New York-based Ohio natives who turn out a kind of pent-up, countrified indie rock that underplays its hand enough to seem modest. The Brooklyn quintet Clap Your Hands Say Yeah recalls the shamanic whine and thrum of mid-1990's lo-fi rocker Neutral Milk Hotel and sometimes the slippery paranoid quirk of the Talking Heads. 8 p.m., Warsaw, 261 Driggs Avenue, Greenpoint, Brooklyn, (718)387-0505, $14.

(Sinagra)    KENNY WAYNE SHEPHERD (Monday) For young blues guitarists like Mr. Shepherd, the blues has as much to do with the Allman Brothers and Jimi Hendrix as it did with Muddy Waters and Robert Johnson. With a baritone howl that's somewhere between Gregg Allman and Robin Trower and a guitar style that looks to Stevie Ray Vaughan, Mr. Shepherd treats the blues as a muscular cry of desperation. 8 p.m., B.B. King's Blues Club and Grill, 237 West 42nd Street, Manhattan; (212)997-4144, $30 in advance, $34. (Pareles)    SICK OF IT ALL (Sunday) The hard-core punk Sick of It All gained unwanted attention in the 90's after Wayne Lo shot up his school wearing one of its T-shirts.

(Sinagra)    XIU XIU, FROG EYES (Tonight) The post-punk Xiu Xiu plays the angular rock so much in fashion these days but ventures outside the lines a bit more than others, collaborating with adventurous pals in Deerhoof.

(Chinen)    *PAUL MOTIAN, JOE LOVANO, BILL FRISELL (Tuesday through Sept. 18) Mr. Motian, a drummer and composer, sets a tone for this blue-chip trio that's shadowy and open-ended as a koan.

Museums    AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'SELF AND SUBJECT,' through Sept. 11. From Grandma Moses' depiction of herself beguiled by infant descendants to A.G. Rizzoli's rendition of his mother as a Gothic cathedral, this refreshingly offbeat show of 20th-century self-taught artists covers a vivid range of portraits. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040. (Grace Glueck)    *BROOKLYN MUSEUM: LUCE CENTER FOR AMERICAN ART VISIBLE STORAGE/STUDY CENTER Sleek vitrines house 1,500 objects from four departments, representing 15 centuries of art and design of the Americas. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000. (Roberta Smith)    COOPER-HEWITT NATIONAL DESIGN MUSEUM: 'EXTREME TEXTILES,' through Oct. 30. Don't look for aesthetic pizzazz in this intensely techy show of industrial fibers and fabrics, but don't rule it out. The show's raison d'être is solely use, but a lot of what's on view, in the first museum display of material made to function in extreme conditions, is visually exciting. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Glueck)    METROPOLITAN MUSEUM OF ART: 'THE BISHOP JADES,' through Feb. 12. Jade has been treasured since ancient times, though the almost preposterously exquisite objects on display in the Met's reinstalled galleries for Chinese decorative arts date from the 18th century, when the Qing dynasty (1644-1911) brought Chinese jade work to a peak of virtuosity. Fifth Avenue and 82nd Street, (212)535-7710. (Holland Cotter)    *MET: 'MATISSE: THE FABRIC OF DREAMS -- HIS ART AND HIS TEXTILES,' through Sept. 25. This somewhat scattered yet astounding exhibition demonstrates that as African sculptures were to the Cubists, so textiles were to Matisse, and revolutionizes the understanding of his life and work. (See above.) (Smith)    MUSEUM OF ARTS AND DESIGN: 'DUAL VISION: THE SIMONA AND JEROME CHAZEN COLLECTION,'  through Sept. 11. A selection of fair to good paintings by artists like Hans Hofmann, Richard Pousette-Dart, John McLaughlin and Roy Lichtenstein and a collection of mostly mediocre ceramics and art glass create a disjunctive hybrid of an exhibition. 40 West 53rd Street, (212)956-3535. (Ken Johnson)    MUSEUM OF BIBLICAL ART: 'THE NEXT GENERATION: CONTEMPORARY EXPRESSIONS OF FAITH,' through Nov. 13. Works in this juried show of artists who belong to the organization Christians in the Visual Arts range from traditional paintings and sculptures to an interactive video and photo documentation of a shamanistic performance in the woods. Ambitious, optically captivating collages by Mary Fielding McCleary and Anita Breitenberg Naylor are among the few pieces that exceed familiar generic limitations. 1865 Broadway at 61st Street, (212)408-1500. (Johnson)    MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'MOUNT ST. HELENS: PHOTOGRAPHS BY FRANK GOHLKE,' through Sept. 26. A year after the eruption of Mount St. Helens in Washington in 1980, this well-known landscape photographer began documenting the explosion's effect on the surrounding terrain. His expansive black-and-white pictures are formally and technically impeccable, but because they err on the side of understatement, they only partly convey a sense of the volcano's destructive violence. 11 West 53rd Street, (212)708-9400. (Johnson)    *MUSEUM OF MODERN ART: 'PIONEERING MODERN PAINTING: CÉZANNE AND PISSARRO,' through Sept. 12. The marriage of minds, sensibilities and influences that Cézanne and Pissarro shared is the subject of this rigorous, beautiful show. Unlike its predecessor, ''Matisse Picasso,'' it is less a grand opera than a lieder recital of deep-running, summer-green Schubertian pleasures. (See above.) (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'FIRST AMERICAN ART,'  through April 9. That American Indian art can provide the same aesthetic and emotional pleasure as European and American Modernism is the premise of this show, made up of 200 objects from the Charles and Valerie Diker Collection, and it affirms American Indian art's worthy aesthetic place in world culture. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700. (Glueck)    NATIONAL ACADEMY MUSEUM: JEAN HÉLION, through Oct. 9. Hélion's conversion, around 1940, from a suave, smartly synthetic mode of geometric abstraction to a like-minded figurative style doesn't put him in a league with great 20th-century apostates like Giacometti, Picabia or Guston. Still, he produced a weirdly fascinating body of work that influenced Americans before and after World War II. This meager show does not give a full account of his strengths or weaknesses, but it is well worth a look. 1083 Fifth Avenue, at 89th Street, (212)369-4880. (Smith)    *NEUE GALERIE: 'WAR/HELL: MASTER PRINTS BY OTTO DIX AND MAX BECKMANN,' through Sept. 26. ''War,'' the German artist Otto Dix's great graphic condemnation of battle, a portfolio of 50 etchings rife with grisly images of trench life and death, battlefield corpses, civilian bombings and other horrors, published after World War I, is paired here with Max Beckmann's ''Hell,'' 10 lithographs from 1918 that comment on war's brutality but also give a sardonic view of the inhumanities he saw as the hell of everyday existence. Their presentation together heightens the impact of each. 1048 Fifth Avenue, at 86th Street, (212)628-6200. (Glueck)    * NEW MUSEUM OF CONTEMPORARY ART: 'SHANGRI-LA,' through Sept. 10. This film by Patty Chang, best known for her performance work, was made in China near the Tibet border. Loosely based on the 1930's novel ''Lost Horizons,'' Ms. Chang's film amplifies and shatters whatever the utopian realness of Shangri-La is, and does so with wit and visual panache. 556 West 22nd Street, Chelsea, (212)219-1222. (Cotter)    P.S. 1 CONTEMPORARY ART CENTER: 'GREATER NEW YORK 2005,' through Sept. 26. A youth-besotted, cheerful, immodestly ingratiating, finally disappointing survey of contemporary art, perusing a scene whose wide stylistic range, emphasis on drawing, persistent teenage infatuations and overall dexterousness are firmly entrenched characteristics of the marketplace. 22-25 Jackson Avenue, at 46th Avenue, Long Island City, Queens, (718)784-2084. (Michael Kimmelman)    QUEENS MUSEUM OF ART: 'DOWN THE GARDEN PATH: THE ARTIST'S GARDEN AFTER MODERNISM,' through Nov. 6. This big, messy and uneven show, still a thought-provoking one for patient and interested viewers, surveys how artists like Vito Acconci, Ian Hamilton Finlay, Mel Chin, Ghada Amer, Stan Douglas and many more have cultivated gardens in fantasy and in reality. Flushing Meadows-Corona Park, (718)592-9700.(Johnson)    * STUDIO MUSEUM IN HARLEM: 'SCRATCH: 2004-2005 ARTISTS-IN-RESIDENCE: WILLIAM CORDOVA, MICHAEL QUEENLAND AND MARC ANDRE ROBINSON,' through Oct. 23 . Rap, religion, Minimalism and Malcolm X all figure in this intricate, multilayered show of work by the three young residents, organized by the museum's associate curator, Christine Y. Kim. 144 West 125th Street, (212)864-4500. (Cotter)    UKRAINIAN MUSEUM: 'ALEXANDER ARCHIPENKO,' through Sept. 18. This rare retrospective of work by the Ukrainian-born sculptor opens the handsome, much-expanded new quarters of this museum. The most exciting part is a beautifully illuminated room of Archipenko's most radical pieces, which inspired later artists like Henry Moore. 222 East Sixth Street, East Village, (212)228-0110. (Glueck)    WHITNEY MUSEUM OF AMERICAN ART: 'REMOTE VIEWING,' through Oct. 9. The vast information overload the world struggles with -- scientific theory, technological data, geopolitical facts, historical material and on and on -- is whipped into visual cosmologies by eight painters of widely different approaches and sensibilities. If the premise is fuzzy, the show has some sharp art, including Carroll Dunham's witty ''Solar Eruption,'' a giant, battered yellow sun that suggests a cell invaded by virus particles, its perimeter bursting with splatlike -- and sometimes unseemly -- extrusions. 945 Madison Avenue, at 75th Street, (212)570-3600. (Glueck)    *WHITNEY MUSEUM: ROBERT SMITHSON, through Oct. 23. Who knows whether Smithson is the most influential American postwar artist, as this show claims. Consisting mostly of drawings, photographs and films (he didn't make that many sculptures, not ones that could fit into a museum, anyway), this is the first full-scale overview of him in the country. It is consequently dry but still compelling testimony to a great exuberance cut drastically short when Smithson died at 35 in a plane crash in 1973. Self-appointed spokesman for earth art, and scavenger of dirt, shells, slag and other materials from the industrial landscape, he helped to shove Minimalism, Conceptualism and Pop in various messy new directions during the 1960's and early 70's. Today, in an era of crabbed imagination and short-term profiteering, the sheer chutzpah of an artist like him is instructive. (See above.) (Kimmelman)    WHITNEY MUSEUM : BANKS VIOLETTE, through Oct. 2. In this labor-intensive installation, Romanticism, tragic violence and rock 'n' roll are evoked as much by the detailed wall label as by the ghostly beams of a burned-out church made of gleaming salt. (See above.) (Smith)    Galleries: Uptown    'BEYOND GEOGRAPHY: FORTY YEARS OF VISUAL ARTS AT THE AMERICAS SOCIETY' Anyone who wants to view art from a hemispheric perspective should see this review of four decades of adventurous art exhibiting by an organization founded to promote understanding among the nations of North, South and Central America. Works here range from a beautiful, all-gold Inca mask to a sound installation by the Canadian avant-garde filmmaker Michael Snow. Americas Society, 680 Park Avenue, at 68th Street, (212)249-8950, through Oct. 8. (Johnson)    'LYONEL FEININGER (1871-1956), A SMALL RETROSPECTIVE OF WORKS ON PAPER' Mostly based on Feininger's constant companion, a sketchbook where he recorded his visual impressions, this show of about 70 small sketches, drawings and watercolors covers his career from 1892, before his artistic direction was clear, to 1953, three years before his death. Fired up by the architectural forms of sailboats, spired churches and soaring skyscrapers, he eventually developed a distinctive style combining radiant planes with lines and geometric forms. The show gives a partial but lively account of his journeys, geographical and aesthetic. Achim Moeller Fine Art, 167 East 73rd Street, (212)988-4500, through Sept. 16. (Glueck)    IRIS VAN DONGEN: 'AURELIA' Most prominent among works playing with various styles are large, possibly ironic drawings of beautiful young women that look as if they were made for the covers of modern romance novels. Salon 94, 12 East 94th Street, (646)672-9212, through Sept. 15. (Johnson)    Galleries: 57th Street    'INTRODUCTIONS' Three one-person minishows: oblique, conceptually evocative photographs by Tim Davis; lurid and juicy paintings of ornate theater interiors by Emi Avora; and diverse drawings and photographs, some funny, some poetic, by Barry Ratoff. Greenberg Van Doren, 730 Fifth Avenue, (212)445-0444, through Sept. 30. (Johnson)    *'REPEAT PERFORMANCE'  More than 20 artists use repetition as their main formal device and many different kinds of materials. The show includes concentric circles drawn by Eva Hesse; black pinstripes painted by Frank Stella; solid glass orbs with opalescent surfaces attached to the wall by Tom Bell; colored wax copies of plastic tumblers by George Stoll; and botanically accurate leaves made entirely of staples by Alison Foshee. Anthony Grant, 37 West 57th Street, (212)755-0434, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    Galleries: Chelsea    'ANOTHER EXPO: BEYOND THE NATION STATE' An international group of eight politically minded conceptualists take on nationalism. The most striking work is Marina Abramovic's large, staged photograph of herself sitting in a mournful posture on a pile of bloody bones. White Box, 525 West 26th Street, (212)714-2347, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    *JUSTIN LOWE This gallery's back room is basically just an extension of a store, but to round out a long, hot city summer, Mr. Lowe has turned it into a combination gallery, library and listening room. Printed Matter gallery, 535 West 22nd Street, (212)925-0325, through Sept. 24. (Cotter)    'ON VIEW: PHOTOGRAPHING THE MUSEUM' Among 20 well-selected ways of picturing the museum are Elliot Erwitt's view of a naked, sculptural Diana aiming her arrow at an unsuspecting live male visitor; wax figures by Hiroshi Sugimoto and Diane Arbus; a specimen drawer full of cardinals (birds, that is) by Terry Evans; and the dreamlike image of three real foxes in a formal period room by Karen Knorr. Yancey Richardson, 535 West 22nd Street, (646)230-9610, through Sept. 17. (Johnson)    *BILL OWENS: 'AMERICA' In new 16-by-20-inch prints, Mr. Owens's photographs of white suburbanites from the 1970's remain poetically beguiling and dryly comical. James Cohan, 533 West 26th Street, (212)714-9500, through Sept. 24. (Johnson)    Other Galleries    'ALONG THE WAY: M.T.A. ARTS FOR TRANSIT' This extensive survey of artworks commissioned over the last two decades by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is more that just a promotional event. Including paintings, drawings, photographs and sculptures by dozens of well-known artists, it is a fascinating window onto an artscape usually only glimpsed by commuters in bits and pieces. UBS, 1285 Sixth Avenue, at 51st Street, (212)713-2885, through Sept. 9. (Johnson)    'ARTISTS AND PATRONS IN TRADITIONAL AFRICAN CULTURES: AFRICAN SCULPTURE FROM THE GARY SCHULZE COLLECTION'  Queensborough Community College has quietly assembled an impressive collection of African art. A year ago, the college inaugurated a permanent display of the collection in its campus gallery. And this summer the gallery is presenting a temporary exhibition of nearly 100 sculptures from a private collection. Queensborough Community College Art Gallery, the City University of New York, 222-05 56th Avenue, Bayside, Queens, (718)631-6396, through Sept. 30. (Cotter)    JOHN BEECH Mr. Beech's elegant, subtly humorous sculptures conjoin Minimalism and utilitarianism; a tall aqua box, for example, looks like a container for parts in a factory that Donald Judd might have built. Peter Blum, 99 Wooster Street, SoHo, (212)343-0441, through Sept. 10, by appointment. (Johnson)    'EXILE, NEW YORK IS A GOOD HOTEL' This new gallery, established by the German-based critic and curator Anke Kempkes, offers a spectacular view of the Empire State Building and a show of work by young artists from Berlin, Glasgow and Warsaw, along with a collaborative slide piece by the New Yorkers Ken Okiishi and Nick Mauss. Broadway 1602, 1182 Broadway, near 28th Street, Apt. 1602, (212)481-0362, through Sept. 16, by appointment. (Cotter)    'A.B. NORMAL'  Seven artists, including John Bock, Tim Hawkinson and Rirkrit Tiravanija, mostly deal in eccentric machinery. Best is a life-size hyper-realistic Zamboni made of rigid pale-green insulation foam by Chris Hanson & Hendrika Sonnenberg. Nyehaus, 15 Gramercy Park South, (212)473-4447, through Sept. 10. (Johnson)    JULIAN OPIE: 'ANIMALS, BUILDINGS, CARS AND PEOPLE' Outdoor sculptures in a coolly understated neo-Pop style, including cars, animals and a group of white skyscrapers with grids of black windows. City Hall Park, Lower Manhattan, (212)980-4575, through Oct. 15. (Johnson)    'PRECIOUS MOMENTS' Mall culture, with its peculiar poignancies, is the theme of ''Precious Moments,'' a smart, sad five-person show organized by the artist Josh Kline. Joymore, 236 Grand Street, Williamsburg, Brooklyn, (646)270-0376, through Sept. 10. (Cotter)    SYLVIA SLEIGH Ms. Sleigh is best known for the male odalisques she painted in the 1970's. The ones in this seven-decade retrospective are comical and embarrassing but still wonderful documents of first-wave feminism, and so is the large 1977 group portrait of members of the all-female cooperative gallery A.I.R. The Newhouse Center for Contemporary Art, at the Snug Harbor Cultural Center, 1000 Richmond Terrace, Livingston, Staten Island, (718)448-2500, through Oct. 2. (Johnson)    Last Chance    *AMERICAN FOLK ART MUSEUM: 'ANCESTRY AND INNOVATION'  This selection of quilts, paintings, sculptures and drawings by several generations of self-taught artists jumps with color and talent, and reflects a sharp curatorial eye. 45 West 53rd Street, (212)265-1040, closing on Sunday. (Smith)    'BODY AND OBJECTS' Depending on your mood, this three-person show might provoke thought or irritation. Most striking are Jiang Zhi's large photographs of two topless dancers, one a woman who has had a double mastectomy, the other a transsexual with breast implants. Tang Yi presents a series of photographs of a young woman blowing up colored balloons into a birdcage, and Chu Yun offers worn bars of soap as miniature sculptures formed by contact with his body. Chambers, 210 11th Avenue, near 24th Street, Chelsea, (212)414-1169, closing today. (Johnson)    BROOKLYN MUSEUM: 'MONET'S LONDON: ARTISTS' REFLECTIONS ON THE THAMES, 1859-1914' This polished and studiously dry show has a dozen of Monet's wildly, paradisaically pretty paintings at its center, surrounded by images of London, many of them prints and photographs by other artists, including Whistler and figures now known primarily to art historians. 200 Eastern Parkway, at Prospect Park, (718)638-5000, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    COOPER-HEWITT: 'HELLA JONGERIUS SELECTS,'  closing on Sunday. Sifting through the museum's outstanding holdings in embroidered samplers, this innovative Dutch designer has selected a wonderfully reverberant show and also based a series of new wall hangings on sampler motifs. Their combined display diagrams the fraught but essential symbiosis of old and new. 2 East 91st Street, (212)849-8400. (Smith)    'DRUNK VS. STONED' This show eschews the usual aesthetic dualities for one that is less about style than lifestyle and proves that it is useful in sorting artworks and their effects. The 39 works assembled represent all mediums and several generations, from early explorers of altered states like Henri Michaux, R. Crumb and Bruce Conner to younger artists like Jason Fox, Huma Bhabha, Evan Holloway Adam McEwen and the Dearraindrop collective. Several touch directly on substance use and abuse in terms of its physiological or interpersonal impact or its social (read class) implications. Others are involved with what might be called the formal aspects of drunk (extroverted, emotional, robustly physical) as opposed to stoned (mesmerizing, becalmed, obsessively repetitious). In some pieces the twain meet. Others are unexpectedly pressed into service by one side or the other and cast in new light. For example, Charles Ray's 1996 short film, ''Fashions,'' comes across here as a masterpiece of stoner focus. ''Better Than Nauman,'' Mike Kelley's video installation, on view in the gallery's old space at Passerby, constitutes drunken subject matter in stoner form. Gavin Brown Enterprise, 620 Greenwich Street, at Leroy Street, Greenwich Village, and Passerby, 436 West 15th Street, Chelsea (212)627-5258, closing on Wednesday. (Smith)    *WILLIAM EGGLESTON: 'THE NIGHTCLUB PORTRAITS' The photographer known for his jewel-like color photographs of scenes of Southern decrepitude made these powerfully lucid black-and-white portraits of customers in bars around Memphis in 1973. Cheim & Read, 547 West 25th Street, Chelsea, (212)242-7727, closing today. (Johnson)    'GIRLS ON FILM' More than 30 artists, from Francis Picabia and Mel Ramos to Lisa Yuskavage and John Currin, are featured in an entertaining exhibition about art inspired by popular erotica. Zwirner & Wirth, 32 East 69th Street, (212)517-8677, closing today. (Johnson)    *INTERNATIONAL CENTER OF PHOTOGRAPHY: 'YOUNG AMERICA' The daguerreotype, an early version of photography, though invented in Europe, was a huge hit in the United States, and you can see why in these extraordinary pictures of a country's political and intellectual elite and its well-heeled citizens. Taken by two members of a well-known Boston studio, each picture glows on the wall like a stone in a mood ring, or a computer screen floating in space. 1133 Avenue of the Americas, at 43rd Street, (212)857-0000, closing on Sunday. (Cotter)    NATIONAL MUSEUM OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN: 'GEORGE CATLIN AND HIS INDIAN GALLERY' The portraits and landscapes here give an account of Plains Indian life in the 1830's in wonderful and sometimes harrowing detail. Viewing it is a remarkable experience. 1 Bowling Green, Lower Manhattan, (212)514-3700, closing on Monday. (Glueck)    'SELF-PRESERVATION SOCIETY' A longtime holdout finally moves to Chelsea and opens a sleek space with a lively show of gallery regulars. Basketball fans must see Tom Sanford's comic-realist painting of last season's infamous brawl between the Pacers and the Pistons. Leo Koenig, 545 West 23rd Street, Chelsea, (212)334-9255, closing tomorrow. (Johnson)    PETER WEGNER: 'LEVER LABYRINTH' Ever wonder what two and a half million sheets of paper would look like? Here they are in stacks of different shades of green. The paper stacks form a maze in the Lever House lobby that you can wander through as though following a path through a geometricized forest. Lever House, 390 Park Avenue, at 52nd Street, (212)421-7927, closing on Sunday.
